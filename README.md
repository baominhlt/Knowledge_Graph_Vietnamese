# Knowledge Graph based in Vietnamese

This is a repository just for practicing Vietnamese NLP.

## Introduction

The repository is relying on the Task-driven Language Modeling
method in the paper ["NLP From Scratch Without Large-Scale Pretraining:
A Simple and Efficient Framework"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04130v1.pdf). \
The main purpose is creating the *target dataset* of the method.
The dataset will be in Vietnamese and in private (sorry for this 
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).
