# Knowledge Graph based in Vietnamese

This is a repository just for practicing Vietnamese NLP.

## Introduction

The repository is relying on the Task-driven Language Modeling
method in the paper ["NLP From Scratch Without Large-Scale Pretraining:
A Simple and Efficient Framework"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04130v1.pdf). \
The main purpose is creating the *target dataset* of the method.
The dataset will be in Vietnamese and in private (sorry for this 
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:). However, I will push in public
the code that I think it will help you by somehow.

## 1. Requirements

You can take a look at my code, I think it is clear enough to
understand. Besides, you want to run the code, you need to prepare
a fit environment. \
I have provided you the *requirement.yml*. You can install the
environment based on that file.

- If you are using conda (I think you should create a new
environment before installing the requirement): \
`conda install --file requirement.yml`
- If you are just using pip: \
`pip install -r requirement.yml`

**Attention:** About *underthesea* package, you have to install
it by *pip* (thanks for the creating [underthesea](https://underthesea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
team :heart_eyes:): \
`pip instal underthesea`
